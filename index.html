		<p class="kernel">This laptop is operating under Kernel version 6.1.10-zen1-1-zen</p>

		<p>Basic installation of Arch Linux</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Why to use Arch Linux?</b> It's lightweight, fast and minimal.</li>
			<li><b>Obtaining Arch Linux</b> You can obtain Arch Linux from <a href="https://archlinux.org/download/">here</a>: installation guide is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide">here</a>.</li>
			<li><b>Installing</b> For beginners, I'd recommend using <code>archinstall</code> to install Linux, I recommend Btrfs with Zstd compression</li>
			<li><b>Post-Install modifications/tweaks</b> I've installed XFCE for better performance.</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Setting up additional features for Arch Linux</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I installed <a title="Simply clone the GitHub repo and use install.sh to install the theme." href="https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-gtk-theme">WhiteSur GTK</a></li>
			<li>I replaced Bash with Zsh (using <a title="Oh My Zsh website; from there you can install it." href="https://ohmyz.sh/">Oh My Zsh)</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>Unresolved issues</p>
		<ul>
			<li>SD Card reader doesn't work at all. I tried with different SD cards, but doesn't work.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Configuration Files</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I changed no configuration files, however, to personalize the Arch install on this laptop, I changed the <abbr title="Depends on what neofetch program you generally use, but most of the configs should be in ~/.config/{program}">neofetch</abbr> and laptop-mode-tools's configuration file.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Other informations</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The laptop is a bit heavier compared to other laptops from the same time period. It weighs about 2.168 kg, which is around 4.780 lbs. Other laptops from the same time period usually weigh between 1.36 kg to 1.81 kg, which is 3 to 4 pounds.</li>
			<li>The laptop is good for simple jobs like watching videos, writing, or making presentations, but it has trouble with harder jobs like playing games;</li>
			<li>The screen reflects like a mirror when you're in a bright light or if there is any light shining on it;</li>
			<li>The color in closed spaces, like in a house, looks pretty accurate;</li>
			<li>The hard disk makes a lot of noise, so it's better to switch to an SSD;</li>
			<li>The typing on the keyboard is not too loud or too quiet, but after using it for a while, the keys seem to bend inward;</li>
			<li>I advise against using 99% isopropyl alcohol to clean the laptop because it can make the plastic look more cloudy than it used to.</li>
			<li>It's easy to replace the battery because as are many available on websites like Amazon.<br>Note: the battery lasts around between 3 hours and 3 hours and a half, but you can make it last longer by installing laptop-mode-tools:
				<pre>yay -S laptop-mode-tools<br>sudo systemctl enable --now laptop-mode.service<br>sudo systemctl start laptop-mode.service</pre>Note: the configuration file is usually at <code>/etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode.conf</code>
			</li>
